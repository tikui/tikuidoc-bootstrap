# Bootstrap Tikui documentation

This is the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) Tikui documentation module.


## Consume this module

To consume this module, you should install it on your Tikui project using the latest version from `tikui/tikui` and then you have to edit the `tikuiconfig.json` to set the documentation name to `bootstrap`:

```json
{
  "documentation": "bootstrap"
}
```

Then you can do exactly what you do with a standard Tikui project.

## About

This module is like a fork of `tikuidoc-tikui` module from version `2.0.0`. The goal of this module is to continue to use Bootstrap as a documentation theme for Tikui.
